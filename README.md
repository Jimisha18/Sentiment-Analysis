# Sentiment-Analysis

The IMDB large movie review dataset has many positive and negative reviews on movies. 
**SOURCE of the dataset:**
Download the dataset here (http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/).

Use the provided training and testing data for your network. You would need to go through data preprocessing to prepare the data for NLP. Then, create a network to classify the review as
positive or negative.

Provide the following:
 train_NLP.py and test_NLP.py files (fill in the ones provided) that train and test the network with the
datasets provided and that run directly from the command line to train and test the network.
o Assume the data resides in the data directory in a folder called aclImdb, exactly like that you
downloaded (please do not upload it!), refer to Figure 1Figure 1 and Figure 2.
 Save the model as ‘YOUR_ID_NLP_model’ in your models directory. Again, save it in any format you
want since you will be loading it yourself in your test file.
 A report explaining all the preprocessing steps you made, the design choices for your network, the
training and testing accuracies, and any comments you have on the output.
